# now we'll look at functions
# functions are a way to create a bit of code that you can run over and over conveniently
# for example, in our analyze_penn.py file we defined a function parsefile that we ran once for each file
# to define a file we use the keyword "def"

def myfunction():
    print "Hello World"

myfunction()
#myfunction()
